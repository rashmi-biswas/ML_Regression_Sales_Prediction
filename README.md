# ML_Regression_Sales_Prediction

Data provided by Rossmann gives various information of about 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers were tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
We are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. Our task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set with the help of given datasets.
In the following project, we have applied machine learning to a real world problem of predicting retail stores sales. Such predictions helps store managers in creating effective staff schedules that increase productivity. We used popular open source programming language Python and used its libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib for modelling, analysis and prediction and visualization.
