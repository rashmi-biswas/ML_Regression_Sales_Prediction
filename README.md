# Retail Sales Prediction

A major challenge for large retailers is to address the needs of the consumers more effectively on a local level, while maintaining the efficiencies of central distribution. As the demand for mass customization by consumers grows, methods focused on store level optimization increase in value.
Prediction of sales is an important application of machine learning in the retail space. Given accurate predictions, retailers can manage dynamic pricing, staff rostering and inventory so as to maximize profit and improve the customer experience. 

<p>
An accurate forecast of sales allows retail outlets to answer questions such as:
<li>Can we use dynamic pricing to maximize our profit?</li>
<li>Do we have enough stock to satisfy demand without being overstocked?</li>
<li>What are the most important factors that affect sales, and how can we optimize them?</li>

Data provided by Rossmann gives various information of about 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers were tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
We are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. Our task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set with the help of given datasets.

In the following project, we have applied machine learning to a real world problem of predicting retail stores sales. Such predictions helps store managers in creating effective staff schedules that increase productivity. We used popular open source programming language Python and used its libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib for modelling, analysis and prediction and visualization.
